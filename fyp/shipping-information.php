          All orders within Pakistan are routed through TCS, Leopords, Call

          will be provided with a tracking ID when the order is dispatched.

          verify, your order will be automatically cancelled after 3 days
          (only applicable to purchases made through Cash on Delivery
          method). Once the order is verified, it will be dispatched within
          1-2 working days and will be delivered to you within 4-5 working
          days. We offer free delivery on orders above Rs.2500 within
